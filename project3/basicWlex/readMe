This collection demonstrates the basics of getting lex and yacc to work 
together. You can execute the demo by first building the application issuing:

$  make <enter>

to run the makefile.

Then, you can execute the parser using imput redirection of the test file t1 
(which is provided) by issuing the command:

$ ./final < t1  <enter>

About the makefile
final depends on lex.yy.c AND y.tab.c but lex.yy.c is not compiled
in the final build because lex.yy.c is included in y.tab.c
